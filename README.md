# Random Fourier Features Classification Performance Test
This repository maintains the code testing the performance of random Fourier features method on several data sets. The results are presented in the experiment section of the paper: [But How Does It Work in Theory? Linear SVM with Random Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04481).

The synthetic data can be generated using the code provided in `datagen.py` under `syndata` folder. The mnist data can be downloaded from [this link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

All the experiments are computed on the University of Michigan's Flux HPC Cluster.
